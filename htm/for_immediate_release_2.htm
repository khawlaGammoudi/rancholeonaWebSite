<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Rancho Leona Sarapiqui 
River Lodge up and running with a new look but same flavor</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">(12/1/2005) Rancho Leona 
located in the Sarapiqui River and Rainforest region of Costa Rica is back to 
business better than ever with a new look. Though guests will discover the same 
eclectic, rustic, relaxed feel and flavor as it had in the past. This region is 
off the beaten path and often overlooked by tourists coming to Costa Rica. But 
it offers some of the best when it comes to exploring the lush tropical 
rainforests and whitewater rivers. Rancho Leona is better prepared than ever to 
show tourists the wonder of this beautiful region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Rancho Leona has been in 
business in La Virgen for over 20 years. In the past the lodge catered to groups 
of kayakers and was a bit of a bunkhouse. Then for a period time became well 
known for its stainglass gallery and art studio. Many beautiful pieces of 
stainglass can still be seen around the lodge. Now it has the feel of a relaxed 
hostel or family budget hotel. Diversity and eclectic is the word here with 
visitors from all over the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Leona Wellington, co-owner 
and operator of the lodge says, “ We did well for many years especially with the 
kayak scene but then we had a couple of rough years and the lodge was even 
closed for awhile. A new business partner has come along and we are back better 
than ever. We have expanded the services we offer and have done a lot of 
remodeling for our visitors and guests.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">She went on to talk about 
how the lodging and kayak safari business is taking off and how the lodge is 
filling up for this new high season.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“All our accommodations are 
looking better than ever and we can see the difference in so many ways but 
especially comments from our guests.&nbsp; I love to read comments in our guestbook. 
We’ve put a lot on our website. Travelers from all over the world send us 
emails, arrive, enjoy, sign our guestbook with comments that let me know we are 
track. Many of our guests don’t speak Spanish or English but it doesn’t matter.&nbsp; 
It’s a wonderful and a great learning experience for all, she adds.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Leona also mentions how 
grateful she is for her family, the volunteers, working guest or angels as she 
likes to call them who contributed to getting the lodge back in business better 
than ever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“I’m excited about our 
future now and could talk on and on about what is happening but it’s best to 
visit our new website
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="../www_rancholeona_default.html">
www.rancholeona.com</a>&nbsp; and of course then come out to be our guest in La 
Virgen, Sarapiqui, she concludes.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Rancho Leona offers budget 
lodging at $12.00 USD per night per person (rates subject to change), group 
discounts, kayak packages from paddling and instruction to advanced custom kayak 
safaris, café, spa services -sauna and massage, high speed internet, gift 
gallery and visitor information center with bilingual staff. Located less than 2 
hours by bus from San Jose makes it an ideal consideration for the those looking 
to explore a part of Costa Rica that’s off the beaten path. </span></p>
