<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Rancho Leona Sarapiqui
River Lodge is undergoing some renovations and is not taking guests for the month of June, 2010</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt">(12/1/2005) Rancho Leona
located in the Sarapiqui River and Rainforest region of Costa Rica will soon be back to
business better than ever with a new look. Though guests will discover the same
eclectic, rustic, relaxed feel and flavor as it had in the past. This region is
off the beaten path and often overlooked by tourists coming to Costa Rica. But
it offers some of the best when it comes to exploring the lush tropical
rainforests and whitewater rivers. Rancho Leona can guide tourists to the wonders of this beautiful region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Rancho Leona has been in
business in La Virgen for over 20 years. In the past the lodge catered to groups
of kayakers and was a bit of a bunkhouse. It is still rustic, but with special touches such as the many beautiful pieces of
stained glass which can be seen around the lodge. It offers a relaxed family atmosphere. Diversity and eclectic is the word here with
visitors from all over the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Leona Wellington, owner of Rancho Leona says, “ We did well for many years, especially with boaters but we had a couple of rough years recently. The earthquake in Vara Blanca, the mud slides in the river, and of course the closing of the scenic Vara Blanca road ,&nbsp; had a big effect on us, and on the river.&nbsp; Fortunately the river has completely recuperated, and our kayaking enthusiasts say that it is now better than ever. Class II, III, and IV start in the same places, and the gradation is more consistent.&nbsp; We are presently doing some renovations at Rancho Leona and expect to offer new services to our guests, in the near future.
